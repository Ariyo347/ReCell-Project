# ReCell-Project
Created a tool that estimates or predicts the future normalized used price of used phones (Adj. R-squared ~ 0.84) which can be used to identify the best models to optimize profit and turnover
Examined over 3,400 phones and 34 phone brands released between 2013 and 2020

## Code and Resources
**Python Version:** 8.2.0
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels

## Data Cleaning
The dataset was mostly clean for modelling. Certain features were engineered into the dataset. These include:
- Creation of column `years_since_release` from the `release_year` column
- I considered the year of data collection, 2021, as the baseline.
- `release_year` column was dropped
There were missing values that treated
